    StaticPool + check_same_thread=False: SQLAlchemy's default SQLite pool
    hands each thread its own connection, which for a `:memory:` database
    means each thread sees a separate, empty database. classify_donors_hybrid
    now runs its sync body via asyncio.to_thread (see donor_classifier_ai.py),
    so a session used across that boundary needs the single shared
    connection StaticPool provides — the same fix production doesn't need
    since a file-backed SQLite DB is the same database regardless of which
    thread opens the connection.

    Production splits SiteVisit/PageView onto their own database file
    (see database.py's VisitsBase) so track-visit's writes can't contend
    with the nightly pipeline's — but tests exercise both through this
    one session/engine either way, so both bases are created here rather
    than standing up a second in-memory engine tests don't need.
